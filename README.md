A small YouTube clone application that implements the following features:  
- Authorization using a Google account
- Loading and displaying a list of videos for predefined categories
- Showing a list of subscriptions and the latest videos uploaded by the channels to which the user is subscribed
- Custom video player that repeats the functionality from the original application
- Videos Search

Part of the functionality is not implemented in the application. It will be added later.  

For the video player to work, it is necessary to have a pre-uploaded video in the project with the name "VideoExample.mp4".    
You can upload your video or download an example video [here](https://github.com/Arctanyn/YouTube-Client/files/11859781/YouTube-Client-Video-Preview.zip)
